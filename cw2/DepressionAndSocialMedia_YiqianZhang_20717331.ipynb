I used to try my best in school despite not getting high scores. I wasn’t too pressed about school, but I still cared. \\n\\nI don’t know how this happened. I have an amazing family that has always loved me and supported me. I have amazing friends that coddle me and care for me. They all have helped me. I am not in a financial crisis, sure we are not rich but we’re doing okay. I am in a prestigious school with nice teachers. Everything around me is amazing, but why am I like this? \\n\\n I’m ruining my life and worrying everyone. I know that I am actively ruining my life. But even knowing this, I just can’t get myself to move. To get something done. To do better. I just want to sleep and never wake up. When these feelings started happening, I just think “it would be better for everyone if I would just die”. I keep lying to everyone. Everyone thinks I’m still okay. Heck my family doesn’t know I haven’t gone to school for 2 weeks nor the fact that I haven’t done my schoolwork. No one knows how bad I’m doing right now. I’m a selfish person. I don’t want to tell my family about what I’m feeling. I don’t want to worry them even more. This has been going on for months now. I just want to disappear so that I stop being a bother to everyone.

I am here today because of the choices I made. Currently I'm unemployed and I don't have a degree. I stay at home all day doing nothing. That's mainly how I've wasted the past five years of my life. I wish I went off to university, took it seriously, made a group of friends, and studied abroad. I wake up every day and think about how I would be studying abroad right now and the memories I would have made. There are no second chances since I come from a low income family. I ask myself why I did the things I did, even though I know that my family is working class. I don't come from a wealthy background so what made me think I had any time or money to waste? Now I am 5 years (which is a fucking long time) behind everyone and I'm watching all of my friends graduate, study in Europe (which I want but will never get to do due to finances, ruining my academic record, and running out of time), and make good money. There is literally no way to catch up to not just to my friends, but to the vision I had for my life. I also still live with my parents in the 570 sq ft one bedroom apartment that I grew up in (I sleep in the living room on a twin bed). I can't stand to live here anymore, but I'm broke. I don't even want to live in Canada anymore. Moving elsewhere likely wouldn't make me happier since I would be even more lonely than I am now. Getting a minimum wage job and moving out is not the solution because minimum wage/close to minimum wage is not sustainable for the rest of my life. The only thing I can feasibly do is get a bachelor's in nursing, but it feels like a last resort. I know I left myself with no choices. I really cannot see myself living in this city for the next 5-7 years and have been contemplating suicide. I really feel trapped and don't see a way out. I had a vision for my 20s, which would have started with a memorable time in university, but I not only missed the boat on that, I have wasted 5 years of youth that I will never get back and am left in a position where I'll be poor for a very long time. University would have been the most likely and easiest place for dating, but that option is closed to me forever. That environment is important to me because it would have been the most organic way to make friends and to meet someone my age to date. Now the time for fun has passed (during which I didn't even have fun), the only thing that's left is work, being poor, and loneliness.\", 'created_utc': 1743831147.0}, {'id': '1jry584', 'subreddit': 'depression', 'post_id': '1jry584', 'text': \"You know I really don't want to leave you.

Like REALLY tired. I'm tired of working my life away to provide for my family and never being able to spend time with them. I'm tired of constantly feeling like I have to be the strong one because no one else will be. I'm tired of all the times I've expressed how I feel just to go unheard. I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one willing to actually take care of my kids needs. I'm tired of wondering if I'm enough. I'm tired of being the breadwinner, housekeeper, father, mother, community to raise everyone else's kids, and the foundation for my job. I'm tired of not feeling like I'm enough for my kids, like I'm not able to do enough, be there enough, and provide enough. I'm tired of constantly watching the neglect happen but not being able to do anything to change it. I'm tired of not being enough. This life is getting the best of me, and maybe the worst. I wasn't prepared for this. And I'm completely alone in my support system to figure out where to go, what to do, who to trust, etc. I don't trust anyone, maybe because I don't trust myself.

The days continue and the sun will still rise and set as though nothing has happened. As though the weight of this lethargicism is not slowly stopping my world from spinning. I'm tired. But sleep doesn't fix the heartache, the abuse, the trauma, the memories that keep me up at night nor the thoughts that are burned into my brain. You're not enough. You're not good enough. You're a failure. You're lazy. You're dumber than a box of rocks. You will never amount to anything. You will end up in jail. You're a deadbeat dad. You're a terrible husband and partner. The world will be better without you. Quieter. But better. I'm tired of feeling like I can control my job, or I can control my house, but I can't do both. I'm tired of constantly feeling like the bad guy, with the best intentions. I'm tired of being misunderstood because of my ability to speak my mind, and seen as intimidating because of my size and the sound of my voice. I'm tired of the judgement. Of the hurt. Of the endless days of toil with no end in sight. I'm tired of this world. But I'm tired of the thought of leaving it and leaving these kids and wife behind. They would get money, but would it matter? Would it make a difference? Would things change? Would the world suddenly be a happier place? Would these kids function the way they should when life comes at them? Sometimes, I wonder if it's worth it. And some days I have reasons to keep going. But it seems like more and more days I have no idea why I try anymore. I go unheard. I go unloved. I am overworked, overstimulated, and overly positive that I have given almost everything I can with nothing to show for it but struggle. I envy the animals whose lives are so simple. The fish that swim everywhere. The birds who fly freely. I'd give anything to feel some morsel of energy or rejuvenation again. I'm so tired, but we keep going because that's what good soldiers do. I hope it's worth it in the end. That we get everything we have worked so hard for. That I can look back someday and wholeheartedly believe that I did everything I could to build the best life possible for my wife and kids. That I can live out my last days with no regrets, knowing that all the compromise, struggles, endless days and nights, and days I spent feeling so  alone actually paid off, because right now, it seems like a task as big as a mountain.

My father died when i was 10 and my mother has raised me very sheltered from the real world, she acts like a child. she teaches pre schoolers and has pretty much my whole life, acts like a 3 year old teacher outside of work as well. extremely childish and hasn’t been in my life very much for about a year or so now. \\n\\ni currently have a boyfriend of 2 years and we have gone through absolute hell with each other. he told me he wanted to break up for a while about 2 weeks ago and we had a conversation and i convinced him to give me another chance. when we first got together i dropped every single thing in my life to cater to him and anything that he needed or wanted. NEVER said no. he was a bit abusive and took advantage of that in our early relationship, but we went through a lot and he has changed quite a bit. then i met a girl, my first friend that i saw on a daily in almost 3 years. i have zero sense of self and identity and as a result i become the people i am around daily. i saw how she lashes out on people when they’re doing something fucked up. so i began to have this mentality that i don’t need to respect what my boyfriend asks of me and i can say whatever i want to him. like “i can’t be doing anything wrong and even if i am it doesn’t matter because i’ve done so much for him in the past”. after one of my rants and me bashing him for past things he said he wanted space and wanted to break up for a while. we had a conversation and i realized a lot of things i have been doing wrong and he decided to give me another chance.\\n\\ntoday he decided to go speed in his car with a friend and decided to turn his location off while he was doing it. when he called me to tell me this he was being very snarky and i got upset, i did not bash him but i told him how he sounded and how the situation didn’t make sense. he then told me he wants to have an in person conversation about our relationship. i asked if we are okay, like as a couple. and he said that that’s exactly what he wants to talk about, because ‘we are not on the same page about that subject’. \\n\\nSince this happened today i have been genuinely considering suicide. My emotions are not in my own control and they never have been, they are merely at the mercy of whoever i deeply care about. and that has been him for a long time. before we got together i always kept trying to kill myself my whole life because i was utterly unable to see any sort of future for myself, my mind would blank, i would slip into an extremely depressive state at just the thought of what a “future” would be. then me and him started dating and that changed. for ONCE in my life i finally saw a future and i finally saw a reason to keep living, he gave that to me. he is the reason i have kept attempting to work on my mental health and to cope in the moments where i feel suicidal. when i tell him he is my world and he is EVERYTHING to me. i mean that with every single fiber of my being. we are one. \\n\\nwithout him i again have no future, i see absolutely nothing for myself, he is the one who gave me something to see in that aspect. he allowed me to see the beauty in life even when i could not feel any beauty in the moment. no medication helps me no amount of therapy helps me NOTHING does except the love i feel from him. \\n\\nso i guess what i’m here to say is, why live when my life and emotions and being are completely subject to this person? that is not fair to him in the slightest. he obviously needs space which i don’t understand but breaking up and giving him space feels like sudden death to me. physically not just mentally i physically feel pain imagining it. literaly my entire life as far as i can remember centers around one person and their mood and their attitude towards me, and what i feel from them. this isn’t something that will just change. i do not want to live if this is what my life will always be. it is agonizing. and i do not want to be told that ‘it won’t always be this way’ because yes it will, it always has and no matter what i do or what i try, it always is this way. if he wants to stay with me then i have a reason to continue living and continue fighting my depression and everything. but at the same time it’s conflicting because i cannot control him and how he acts, therefore i am always completely subjective to HIM. i do not want to be alive if this is what my life means.\\n\\nI have 2 cats. and they are extremely attached to me, every time i think about ending my life i picture them and i picture them not knowing where i went or what happened to me. them being in the care of somebody else, just waiting every single day for me to come home. they are registered emotional support animals for me and they care about me more then anybody. what the fuck do i do? do i wait for them to pass/die so i’m not hurting them when i am gone? do i just leave them in the care of somebody i know will treat them well and it just be a sad thing i will have to deal with but not for much longer? i can’t stand the thought of not coming home to then every night. i don’t know what to do and i feel extremely stuck. please help me.\\n\\nas i’m writing this they are crawling on me and one of them is licking my tears and they’re jsut being extremely lovey and cuddly and won’t leave me alone. they always just know.', 'created_utc': 1743832570.0}, {'id': '1jrb3f3', 'subreddit': 'depression', 'post_id': '1jrb3f3', 'text': 'A bit of context.

After the entrance exams and I started to move away from the school environment, I started walking, aimlessly, I just took a bottle of water and walked for hours, for kilometers, and I wasn\\'t understanding why, and now I see (still very reluctantly) that these moments of impulsiveness that I called \"I don\\'t know\", were me telling myself to live, this is so shocking, at one point I was trying to understand why my emotion of living surpasses even today the \"rationality\" of dying. I spent years being completely sure of my undeniable desire for death, to now understand that this IS an illness. That I\\'m not really like that, that everything I know about myself is covered by a morbid veil and, pardon the pun, a depressive veil. I haven\\'t started taking depression medication yet, on those days to try to intensify the crises I ended up taking heavier medications for focus and attention, I don\\'t know if they had any effect, but I took about 4 capsules at once. \\nI\\'m feeling like I\\'m in limbo, I\\'m just existing, at that moment I just said goodnight to my \"beloved\" she was at college and was tired, I was blaming myself so much for making her go through this, not just her, but mainly her, we have several friends and she\\'s kind of the center of the group, and one of the closest to her also has depression, he\\'s known for longer than me, I talked to him this week, and I was so worried about him, I\\'ve never had as much hope as I am. this week, I even left my room, but I thought so much, I even read it. I ended up going to chat gpt my situation and asked if there was any school or philosophical or social or psychological current that fit my thoughts (a way of searching for thoughts or at least paths/tools to reach something), he told me what my beloved told me (she has been through problematic situations too) I am very idealistic, I didn\\'t have a good philosophical education in high school, I didn\\'t know what idealism is, and he also told me that I have existentialist thoughts (in this case, I\\'ve heard about Sartre, but I always avoided reading anything because it seemed like I would freak out if I really understood). This ended up catching me off guard, I didn\\'t know that the thoughts I was guided by actually had the name \"idealism\" and that they had so many problems. From what I understand, and also from conversations with older people, who don\\'t have as much intellectual knowledge but have a lot of experience, they told me that this is something normal, this feeling (which worried me, because walking to college and seeing a bus passing by and wanting to jump on it, doesn\\'t seem like that\\'s normal), and that it\\'s a passing thing, that I should take it easy, I shouldn\\'t have missed this college opportunity, that I should start to occupy my mind so that I don\\'t have space or time to think about it anymore, that I should get a job, a girlfriend, train, get to know the city (because I moved. For reasons of reference, I\\'m from Brazil, I\\'m from the interior of the state of São Paulo in a city with 140 thousand inhabitants, and I moved to the state capital, which has 16 million inhabitants, even more in fact) and that that will always be with me and I should lean on these things... I\\'m afraid, I didn\\'t think I was leaning on my loved one but in the end I was, I hurt myself for one reason only. mine, an unnecessary question in my opinion, she tells me that I am someone very important to her (since the event, I imagine that based on my reaction, she hasn\\'t said that she loves me. Which was already a shock when she said it for the first time because she had an emotional block, she told me that I was her first love, I don\\'t know how I could make her understand a feeling of that magnitude for someone like me in the state I\\'m in), and I hurt myself alone for a reason that made my mind complex and made it 20 times worse than what had actually happened. I have no religion, as a Brazilian descendant of Italians I was raised under the rules of the Catholic church, and my first reactions of dissatisfaction in relation to these emotional supports were in the church. I\\'m very afraid of holding on to something again, and holding on tighter, because that would help me get through it, it would be so much more pleasurable, just throwing faith in the hands of a perfect God... But that doesn\\'t enter my head, I won\\'t be able to support myself in religion, in sport or in studies, I don\\'t look badly on those who don\\'t support them, but I judge them. The course I took was for the sake of being the easiest for me to get into, geography, I\\'m good at it and I like consuming content about it, I didn\\'t study once for the entrance exam, it was just video classes while I played, it gave me a moral blow when I found out that I passed (for those who don\\'t know, passing a public university in Brazil is the ideal for a career), I didn\\'t feel like I belonged to that place, I didn\\'t make an effort to be there, while the friends I took I knew they made an effort, they wanted to, I didn\\'t... I had been taking classes for a month now, I barely read the texts the teachers gave me, I just paid attention in class, and I imagined arriving at my rented kitchenette which had so many problems that I didn\\'t feel comfortable, but at least it was a place where I could, I don\\'t know, take off my clothes, sit on the floor and cry. \\n\\nI understand this period now, as a period of extreme immaturity, for making so many decisions without feeling, although nothing is relevant. It\\'s a period in which I\\'m seeing how I don\\'t know life, and how I\\'m trying to understand it, and up until now I\\'ve only idealized it, and I\\'m afraid of idealizing it yet, I don\\'t know if I should go back to my studies after the treatment starts, if I should try something that the chances of me regretting are minimal, I\\'d like to try medicine or psychology, be able to help people, and research and try to understand what they and I have. The problem is that these courses are extremely competitive, medicine for example, there is a college in my city that is one of the best in my country, but it is so competitive that the number of mistakes in the entrance exam is around a maximum of 5 points, in a test where you can get 200, in other words, I couldn\\'t make a mistake. Should I put myself in this situation? Probably years of study, or if I have another miracle (ahahah) I can pass it this year or next year? Should I go after my love and try to make it as strong as I can, or should I maintain a relationship without so much romantic closeness (which she would like) or should I just treat her as a friend that I love. I\\'m afraid of people forgetting me, I don\\'t know if I would feel free in peace, or if I would feel free to kill myself. From what I understand, I should take advantage of this moment to understand myself (I don\\'t know how) and focus on myself, stop putting people before me, think more about myself, which are thoughts that bother me because they seem selfish, even though everyone tells me they aren\\'t, because unfortunately the only thing I have that isn\\'t so fleeting is me.\\nI don\\'t know if anyone will read all of this, I would like to thank you for your efforts (I really can\\'t imagine anyone reading all of this, so thank you very much if you read S2). Now I honestly don\\'t know how to live, and from what I\\'m finding out, no one does. I\\'ll try to read more, I think this is the support that seems to bring the most benefits, which I can perhaps pass on to others (I would like to have children hahah). I don\\'t know if I\\'m turning this disease into something very psychological yet, THESE THINGS ARE DISEASES, I have to understand this to continue. \\n\\nAfter all, I\\'m only 17...

That being said it would be nice to find someone that truly cares about me and supports me in a healthy way, but again, I don't know if I will ever find that\\n\\nI go out of my way to make the people around me happy, and have a very hard time saying no to people for things like if they ask me for money to help them out in a tight spot. I still listen to people if they need to vent, despite my own struggles. Just a little while ago I was at a concert for an artist I like to listen to, and ordered a custom made plush animal version of their cat to give them. They noticed it and pointed at me and motioned for me to toss it to them, which I did, and she had quite the big smile on her face. Definitely made that quite a happy memorable event for me.\\n\\nUnfortunately I might have went a little overboard trying to get her to notice me online somehow and would tag her and her bandmates (her bandmates because she seems pretty heavily reserved and closed off to fanmail/fan communications of any kind, which is her right of course and understandable given the dangers in this world with some dangerous people) saying how much her music has helped me some days and how happy that moment was seeing her happy from the gift I got her.\\n\\nHer bandmates definitely noticed the post but of course they don't say anything, which sends my anxiety into overdrive, but thinking more rationally about it now, they do have their own busy lives and are currently all on tour, plus I'm not owed any communication from anyone anyway, which wouldn't be fair to expect anuway. I'm sure they were happy seeing the post I tagged them in as it's not like it was anything negative, but maybe perhaps I was just thirsting for a little bit of validation or acknowledgement with trying to be noticed online like that. A way to make me feel a little less lonely and knowing an artist saw how impactful their work has been to me etc..\\n\\nAt this point I stopped that and am just going to try to respect them all by just giving them space and just trying to be happy from that good memory of the plush animal thing, and continuing to support them by listening to more future music from them and following their other works in other bands etc. I love music and finding new artists every day, music definitely can bring lots of people together from different backgrounds which I love\\n\\nI really hope I can eventually overcome the dark cloud that always hangs above me, but I have very little faith I will be able to. I fear what might happen or how badly I might snap when things inevitably get way more stressful in my life with family getting older and dying off, making me feel even more lonely. Unfortunately even with the huge heart I have, many people misunderstand me, misunderstand my huge fear I have of things like being ignored, etc.. I hate that sometimes I can stress myself out from anxiety and stress and depression that I can lash out which I usually quickly regret afterwards. I really don't know how much longer I can take just trying to get better and improve and learn to cope and be happy but I do know that when things get way more difficult, it's going to be extremely hard for me to really think of any reason for me to stay here.

Sometimes you are born into situations where the noose is tied but instead of dropping you you are left to rot in the sun to eventually be set free. I have alot to be thankful for i've gotten passed that but sometimes people just wont care. People tend to pick and choose what struggle is. That's society. Struggle shouldn't be a competition but it ends up being it because that's life. Why the none insane response because this sobered me up. I kinda thought man Im unemployed alone with no care for reaching out unless my mother complained. I thought Im the only one rotting hoping to get a buzz or a blackout. Look today almost made me go ok this and that but look bro never side with people just because you wanna go ok here you go. I understand that comment will go seen one day idk. To be fair I deserve any negative attention. Why im sharing that is because you should never be out there sinking. You breath you live you are. That's life. Keep on limping bro that's still moving.\", 'created_utc': 1743829746.0}, {'id': 'mlgw06n', 'subreddit': 'depression', 'post_id': 'mlgw06n', 'text': \"Please don't end it soon, you are still very young and I know you probably feel like you have already lived through enough, that time was so slow and painful but you can do this.

      "so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).\n",

So I’ve only had ptsd for about 5 years now after a near death experience and I just want to know if you guys think it is possible for me to be able to get rid of it for good. That fact that I was not born with a generalized anxiety disorder really makes me believe that one day I’ll be able to be the person I was before the incident. The issue is that even when I ask my therapist about this he tells me that my anxiety will always be there from now on, I just have to learn how to deal with it. What are your thoughts?\n",

I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while. I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations, and this job pushed that (being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers) but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town.

So the first time I was at the dining hall and all of a sudden all the voices around me began to seem echoey and I had a spike of that warm panicky feeling in my body. I quickly got up to put my plate on the dumbwaiter and left the dining hall and it subsided fairly quickly, I didn't really think much of it.

      "Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person, well it ended up being exactly what I feared, she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so \"over dramatic\" and that \"I'm just anxious for attention\".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own, she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that, but she has been like this for a few years now, I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was \"nothing\" and it turned out to be cellulitis. Ever since I came back from Melbourne, I've just been overthinking things, and when I do, it flares the anxiety right up.\n",

Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person!

Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with \"I wanted to see you more than anything.\" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.\n",

Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors.

Naturally, this difficult transition wasn't made any easier when mom began calling me to claim I was faking being disabled because I'd seen the actually disabled people in/around my life, how easy they had it not having to work, and I just wanted to do that. For financial reasons, I haven't been able to return to college, but I genuinely want to if it ever becomes feasible.

      "I have skipped college for 2 weeks already, and I feel like I am about to get dropped off by my college course. I haven’t done my schoolwork in months. I just can’t bring myself to move. I haven’t done my laundry in over a month and right now I have no more clothes to wear. I lost my care in hygiene, I don’t shower and can’t be bothered to brush my teeth. There was at some point molds because I haven’t done my dishes for 2 weeks. There’s food in my fridge that I haven’t taken out yet and it’s molding. Because of that I didn’t eat for 3 days, only drinking water. I can’t get out of my bed. I can’t even be bothered to clean after eating, I just leave my things alone. I don’t even feel hungry anymore. I don’t even have room to walk because my room is just filled with trash. Heck I’m sleeping on an inflatable bed because my bed is just filled with random trash and stuff. I can’t find my things because it’s lost somewhere in my room. I just don’t have the energy to care right now. \n",

Everyone thinks I’m still okay. Heck my family doesn’t know I haven’t gone to school for 2 weeks nor the fact that I haven’t done my schoolwork. No one knows how bad I’m doing right now. I’m a selfish person. I don’t want to tell my family about what I’m feeling. I don’t want to worry them even more. This has been going on for months now.

      "If you go to my post history, you can get a picture of how I got to where I am in life today. I am here today because of the choices I made. Currently I'm unemployed and I don't have a degree. I stay at home all day doing nothing. That's mainly how I've wasted the past five years of my life. I wish I went off to university, took it seriously, made a group of friends, and studied abroad. I wake up every day and think about how I would be studying abroad right now and the memories I would have made. There are no second chances since I come from a low income family. I ask myself why I did the things I did, even though I know that my family is working class. I don't come from a wealthy background so what made me think I had any time or money to waste? Now I am 5 years (which is a fucking long time) behind everyone and I'm watching all of my friends graduate, study in Europe (which I want but will never get to do due to finances, ruining my academic record, and running out of time), and make good money. There is literally no way to catch up to not just to my friends, but to the vision I had for my life. I also still live with my parents in the 570 sq ft one bedroom apartment that I grew up in (I sleep in the living room on a twin bed). I can't stand to live here anymore, but I'm broke. I don't even want to live in Canada anymore. Moving elsewhere likely wouldn't make me happier since I would be even more lonely than I am now. Getting a minimum wage job and moving out is not the solution because minimum wage/close to minimum wage is not sustainable for the rest of my life. The only thing I can feasibly do is get a bachelor's in nursing, but it feels like a last resort. I know I left myself with no choices. I really cannot see myself living in this city for the next 5-7 years and have been contemplating suicide. I really feel trapped and don't see a way out. I had a vision for my 20s, which would have started with a memorable time in university, but I not only missed the boat on that, I have wasted 5 years of youth that I will never get back and am left in a position where I'll be poor for a very long time. University would have been the most likely and easiest place for dating, but that option is closed to me forever. That environment is important to me because it would have been the most organic way to make friends and to meet someone my age to date. Now the time for fun has passed (during which I didn't even have fun), the only thing that's left is work, being poor, and loneliness.\n",

      "You know I really don't want to leave you. I don't want to feel alone. But I feel alone already. I feel like I've been investing in us, with nothing back to show for it. And maybe that's life. But it's how I feel. I'm tired. Like REALLY tired. I'm tired of working my life away to provide for my family and never being able to spend time with them. I'm tired of constantly feeling like I have to be the strong one because no one else will be. I'm tired of all the times I've expressed how I feel just to go unheard. I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one willing to actually take care of my kids needs. I'm tired of wondering if I'm enough. I'm tired of being the breadwinner, housekeeper, father, mother, community to raise everyone else's kids, and the foundation for my job. I'm tired of not feeling like I'm enough for my kids, like I'm not able to do enough, be there enough, and provide enough. I'm tired of constantly watching the neglect happen but not being able to do anything to change it. I'm tired of not being enough. This life is getting the best of me, and maybe the worst. I wasn't prepared for this. And I'm completely alone in my support system to figure out where to go, what to do, who to trust, etc. I don't trust anyone, maybe because I don't trust myself. I'm tired of drinking my life away to feel happiness or relief. I'm tired of smoking weed and seeing the financial burden it plays into our finances. I'm tired of constantly talking in conversations but getting nothing back, like it's all one sided. I'm tired of feeling like I'm too smart for what I do, but too dumb for this world. I'm tired of feeling like I'm never enough. For my kids. My wife. My job. Myself. My God. I'm tired. But sleep and rest don't help. The world keeps turning. The days continue and the sun will still rise and set as though nothing has happened. As though the weight of this lethargicism is not slowly stopping my world from spinning. I'm tired. But sleep doesn't fix the heartache, the abuse, the trauma, the memories that keep me up at night nor the thoughts that are burned into my brain. You're not enough. You're not good enough. You're a failure. You're lazy. You're dumber than a box of rocks. You will never amount to anything. You will end up in jail. You're a deadbeat dad. You're a terrible husband and partner. The world will be better without you. Quieter. But better. I'm tired of feeling like I can control my job, or I can control my house, but I can't do both. I'm tired of constantly feeling like the bad guy, with the best intentions. I'm tired of being misunderstood because of my ability to speak my mind, and seen as intimidating because of my size and the sound of my voice. I'm tired of the judgement. Of the hurt. Of the endless days of toil with no end in sight. I'm tired of this world. But I'm tired of the thought of leaving it and leaving these kids and wife behind. They would get money, but would it matter? Would it make a difference? Would things change? Would the world suddenly be a happier place? Would these kids function the way they should when life comes at them? Sometimes, I wonder if it's worth it. And some days I have reasons to keep going. But it seems like more and more days I have no idea why I try anymore. I go unheard. I go unloved. I am overworked, overstimulated, and overly positive that I have given almost everything I can with nothing to show for it but struggle. I envy the animals whose lives are so simple. The fish that swim everywhere. The birds who fly freely. I'd give anything to feel some morsel of energy or rejuvenation again. I'm so tired, but we keep going because that's what good soldiers do. I hope it's worth it in the end. That we get everything we have worked so hard for. That I can look back someday and wholeheartedly believe that I did everything I could to build the best life possible for my wife and kids. That I can live out my last days with no regrets, knowing that all the compromise, struggles, endless days and nights, and days I spent feeling so  alone actually paid off, because right now, it seems like a task as big as a mountain. And I don't know if I can climb a mountain right now, because I'm tired..\n",

I went through some really bad addiction with drugs and alcohol which is ultimately why she left.... I was a disaster and really lost all my friends and self respect from the way I handled it all those years ago... It was a shit show. Fast forward to today. I have been sober a few years, gotten some education and landed my first decent job. (I work in I.T. at a well known and respected college) \n",

She married some bald guy she met in college shorty after she got away from me. It just cuts me so deep. I hate myself for the way I acted and the things I did. Also, I've never driven by houses or tried to come in physical contact but I know that a lot of people would consider keeping up with her life as creepy... I have had girlfriends since and actually did some traveling for a while and at one point in between the time we split and now I did some traveling and was really living my life without a thought or care in the world about this... But somehow I always come full circle and really wish I were a different person. I don't like myself and have really reduced myself to being at a computer most waking hours of most days... Sometimes I start to think clearly and know I wouldnt know what to do with a wife that is such a catch and so put together. I can't keep someone like that happy.... I just don't like who I've become. \n",

      "I have intense childhood trauma and have been diagnosed with depression since i was 9. 10 years later in life i am diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, depression, psychosis, and borderline personality disorder. I have spent my entire life between ages 9-18 in and out of mental hospitals, bouncing between therapist to therapist and psychiatrist to psychiatrist. I am out of medication to try and my next option is shock therapy. I have shown signs of borderline personality disorder since i was 13 and have tried to end my life more times then i can keep track of. \n",

      "I have always had one person in my life at a time that i DEEPLY care for and love to my core, and everything about them controls my every emotion. My father died when i was 10 and my mother has raised me very sheltered from the real world, she acts like a child. she teaches pre schoolers and has pretty much my whole life, acts like a 3 year old teacher outside of work as well. extremely childish and hasn’t been in my life very much for about a year or so now. \n",

      "i currently have a boyfriend of 2 years and we have gone through absolute hell with each other. he told me he wanted to break up for a while about 2 weeks ago and we had a conversation and i convinced him to give me another chance. when we first got together i dropped every single thing in my life to cater to him and anything that he needed or wanted. NEVER said no. he was a bit abusive and took advantage of that in our early relationship, but we went through a lot and he has changed quite a bit. then i met a girl, my first friend that i saw on a daily in almost 3 years. i have zero sense of self and identity and as a result i become the people i am around daily. i saw how she lashes out on people when they’re doing something fucked up. so i began to have this mentality that i don’t need to respect what my boyfriend asks of me and i can say whatever i want to him. like “i can’t be doing anything wrong and even if i am it doesn’t matter because i’ve done so much for him in the past”. after one of my rants and me bashing him for past things he said he wanted space and wanted to break up for a while. we had a conversation and i realized a lot of things i have been doing wrong and he decided to give me another chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "today he decided to go speed in his car with a friend and decided to turn his location off while he was doing it. when he called me to tell me this he was being very snarky and i got upset, i did not bash him but i told him how he sounded and how the situation didn’t make sense. he then told me he wants to have an in person conversation about our relationship. i asked if we are okay, like as a couple. and he said that that’s exactly what he wants to talk about, because ‘we are not on the same page about that subject’. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since this happened today i have been genuinely considering suicide. My emotions are not in my own control and they never have been, they are merely at the mercy of whoever i deeply care about. and that has been him for a long time. before we got together i always kept trying to kill myself my whole life because i was utterly unable to see any sort of future for myself, my mind would blank, i would slip into an extremely depressive state at just the thought of what a “future” would be. then me and him started dating and that changed. for ONCE in my life i finally saw a future and i finally saw a reason to keep living, he gave that to me. he is the reason i have kept attempting to work on my mental health and to cope in the moments where i feel suicidal. when i tell him he is my world and he is EVERYTHING to me. i mean that with every single fiber of my being. we are one. \n",
      "\n",
      "without him i again have no future, i see absolutely nothing for myself, he is the one who gave me something to see in that aspect. he allowed me to see the beauty in life even when i could not feel any beauty in the moment. no medication helps me no amount of therapy helps me NOTHING does except the love i feel from him. \n",
      "\n",
      "so i guess what i’m here to say is, why live when my life and emotions and being are completely subject to this person? that is not fair to him in the slightest. he obviously needs space which i don’t understand but breaking up and giving him space feels like sudden death to me. physically not just mentally i physically feel pain imagining it. literaly my entire life as far as i can remember centers around one person and their mood and their attitude towards me, and what i feel from them. this isn’t something that will just change. i do not want to live if this is what my life will always be. it is agonizing. and i do not want to be told that ‘it won’t always be this way’ because yes it will, it always has and no matter what i do or what i try, it always is this way. if he wants to stay with me then i have a reason to continue living and continue fighting my depression and everything. but at the same time it’s conflicting because i cannot control him and how he acts, therefore i am always completely subjective to HIM. i do not want to be alive if this is what my life means.\n",

      "A bit of context. I’m almost 32 now I think I’ve been severely depressed for the last 7 years. Seven years ago, I had a breakdown while I was studying to be an elementary school teacher. I had to go to a psychiatric hospital for a couple of weeks. Since then, I ended up in disability for my severe anxiety and depression and for 7 years I did some volonteer work but never had a real job. Most days I pass them in my bed wondering what is wrong with me. Sometimes I’ve even dissociated (like today). I never got to finish college and never got a real job. I live alone, and have housework chores to do but I can’t even bring myself to do them because my mind is in a very dark place. I want to get my life back, I’m currently in a program to go back to work again but I’m scared because my days are like this and don’t know if I am ready. On one part, I want to work very badly on the other, I am very afraid I’m not used to it anymore. How can I prepare myself to the best in order to go to work? How can I acquire a healthy routine without going into those dark places and not doing anything all day? Any help/advice? \n",

I come from a poor Hispanic household so I knew I  had to go back to do something for my parents. However my father was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer stage 2. I know stage 2 isn't as life threatening but my father who is 62, and has nobody else besides me, bcuz him and my mom are separated. It wayed down heavly on my mentally. My father got treated at out local hospital but that hospital could not help him anymore after 6 months because his cancer was growing rapidy and so he was transfered and put on a clinical trial to help stop it. I thought that would be the end of my worries but my mother passed away  last year due to a blood infection, and the month prior to that I lost my job. And her family and me spent alot money sending her back to the mexico where she was buried. I accuried debt because of all this. I miss mom alot, she was in my eyes a bad ass mexican mom who never showed an ounce of being scared, always fearless, tough. I'm sure people who grow in a Hispanic house hold understand that.Seeing someone like her, who was always strong and showed unconditional love to me. Die in the way she did. Messed up. I feel useless not being able to even buy her a house or do anything for her. And I feel the same for father. I always grew up thinking I do something for them and help them.

      "I don't know where to start, I was diagnosed a week ago (last Saturday), I haven't started treatment yet. My world turned upside down, so many things happened, I ended up canceling my university registration, I appeared to be very shaken by an event; the person I understand that I love, because it fits all the logic of love, kissed someone else, and that was just one of the triggers; I put everything I understood into question. I questioned myself from start to finish and I still question myself, I don't feel like I'm ready to live, much less that I'll be ready one day. I have been struggling with depression since I was a child, and I always understood that the problem was me, in my way of thinking, being, acting, which made me try to kill myself a few times, I never got far, the third time I tried I must have been around 12 years old and that was when I put a knife to my neck and pressed. I couldn't finish the job, and I never understood why. This was always in my head, I always called myself a coward for it. But now that actually seems to have been something, something that had never crossed my mind, but that never stopped showing signs, 2 years ago I started going to the gym, I went alone and thought about life while I was pushing, I stopped 5 months ago. After the entrance exams and I started to move away from the school environment, I started walking, aimlessly, I just took a bottle of water and walked for hours, for kilometers, and I wasn't understanding why, and now I see (still very reluctantly) that these moments of impulsiveness that I called \"I don't know\", were me telling myself to live, this is so shocking, at one point I was trying to understand why my emotion of living surpasses even today the \"rationality\" of dying. I spent years being completely sure of my undeniable desire for death, to now understand that this IS an illness. That I'm not really like that, that everything I know about myself is covered by a morbid veil and, pardon the pun, a depressive veil. I haven't started taking depression medication yet, on those days to try to intensify the crises I ended up taking heavier medications for focus and attention, I don't know if they had any effect, but I took about 4 capsules at once. \n",
      "I'm feeling like I'm in limbo, I'm just existing, at that moment I just said goodnight to my \"beloved\" she was at college and was tired, I was blaming myself so much for making her go through this, not just her, but mainly her, we have several friends and she's kind of the center of the group, and one of the closest to her also has depression, he's known for longer than me, I talked to him this week, and I was so worried about him, I've never had as much hope as I am. this week, I even left my room, but I thought so much, I even read it. I ended up going to chat gpt my situation and asked if there was any school or philosophical or social or psychological current that fit my thoughts (a way of searching for thoughts or at least paths/tools to reach something), he told me what my beloved told me (she has been through problematic situations too) I am very idealistic, I didn't have a good philosophical education in high school, I didn't know what idealism is, and he also told me that I have existentialist thoughts (in this case, I've heard about Sartre, but I always avoided reading anything because it seemed like I would freak out if I really understood). This ended up catching me off guard, I didn't know that the thoughts I was guided by actually had the name \"idealism\" and that they had so many problems. From what I understand, and also from conversations with older people, who don't have as much intellectual knowledge but have a lot of experience, they told me that this is something normal, this feeling (which worried me, because walking to college and seeing a bus passing by and wanting to jump on it, doesn't seem like that's normal), and that it's a passing thing, that I should take it easy, I shouldn't have missed this college opportunity, that I should start to occupy my mind so that I don't have space or time to think about it anymore, that I should get a job, a girlfriend, train, get to know the city (because I moved. For reasons of reference, I'm from Brazil, I'm from the interior of the state of São Paulo in a city with 140 thousand inhabitants, and I moved to the state capital, which has 16 million inhabitants, even more in fact) and that that will always be with me and I should lean on these things... I'm afraid, I didn't think I was leaning on my loved one but in the end I was, I hurt myself for one reason only. mine, an unnecessary question in my opinion, she tells me that I am someone very important to her (since the event, I imagine that based on my reaction, she hasn't said that she loves me. Which was already a shock when she said it for the first time because she had an emotional block, she told me that I was her first love, I don't know how I could make her understand a feeling of that magnitude for someone like me in the state I'm in), and I hurt myself alone for a reason that made my mind complex and made it 20 times worse than what had actually happened. I have no religion, as a Brazilian descendant of Italians I was raised under the rules of the Catholic church, and my first reactions of dissatisfaction in relation to these emotional supports were in the church. I'm very afraid of holding on to something again, and holding on tighter, because that would help me get through it, it would be so much more pleasurable, just throwing faith in the hands of a perfect God... But that doesn't enter my head, I won't be able to support myself in religion, in sport or in studies, I don't look badly on those who don't support them, but I judge them. The course I took was for the sake of being the easiest for me to get into, geography, I'm good at it and I like consuming content about it, I didn't study once for the entrance exam, it was just video classes while I played, it gave me a moral blow when I found out that I passed (for those who don't know, passing a public university in Brazil is the ideal for a career), I didn't feel like I belonged to that place, I didn't make an effort to be there, while the friends I took I knew they made an effort, they wanted to, I didn't... I had been taking classes for a month now, I barely read the texts the teachers gave me, I just paid attention in class, and I imagined arriving at my rented kitchenette which had so many problems that I didn't feel comfortable, but at least it was a place where I could, I don't know, take off my clothes, sit on the floor and cry. \n",

      "I understand this period now, as a period of extreme immaturity, for making so many decisions without feeling, although nothing is relevant. It's a period in which I'm seeing how I don't know life, and how I'm trying to understand it, and up until now I've only idealized it, and I'm afraid of idealizing it yet, I don't know if I should go back to my studies after the treatment starts, if I should try something that the chances of me regretting are minimal, I'd like to try medicine or psychology, be able to help people, and research and try to understand what they and I have. The problem is that these courses are extremely competitive, medicine for example, there is a college in my city that is one of the best in my country, but it is so competitive that the number of mistakes in the entrance exam is around a maximum of 5 points, in a test where you can get 200, in other words, I couldn't make a mistake. Should I put myself in this situation? Probably years of study, or if I have another miracle (ahahah) I can pass it this year or next year? Should I go after my love and try to make it as strong as I can, or should I maintain a relationship without so much romantic closeness (which she would like) or should I just treat her as a friend that I love. I'm afraid of people forgetting me, I don't know if I would feel free in peace, or if I would feel free to kill myself. From what I understand, I should take advantage of this moment to understand myself (I don't know how) and focus on myself, stop putting people before me, think more about myself, which are thoughts that bother me because they seem selfish, even though everyone tells me they aren't, because unfortunately the only thing I have that isn't so fleeting is me.\n",
      "I don't know if anyone will read all of this, I would like to thank you for your efforts (I really can't imagine anyone reading all of this, so thank you very much if you read S2). Now I honestly don't know how to live, and from what I'm finding out, no one does. I'll try to read more, I think this is the support that seems to bring the most benefits, which I can perhaps pass on to others (I would like to have children hahah). I don't know if I'm turning this disease into something very psychological yet, THESE THINGS ARE DISEASES, I have to understand this to continue. \n",

      "\n",
      "I cannot stand any stressful situation for the life of me, I fear the future with my grandma and my parents and everyone getting older and dying, which will eventually happen, such is life, but with how alone I already feel I just know it will get worse when all that happens and I don't know if I'll be able to tolerate it all when it does happen.\n",

      "I have no girlfriend and feel like I will never attract one, and not like I'd truthfully be interested in one until I get my own shit together, because I do know it would be unfair to a partner if I over-relied on them for my own happiness, which would be unhealthy and detrimental to any relationship. That being said it would be nice to find someone that truly cares about me and supports me in a healthy way, but again, I don't know if I will ever find that\n",
      "\n",
      "I go out of my way to make the people around me happy, and have a very hard time saying no to people for things like if they ask me for money to help them out in a tight spot. I still listen to people if they need to vent, despite my own struggles. Just a little while ago I was at a concert for an artist I like to listen to, and ordered a custom made plush animal version of their cat to give them. They noticed it and pointed at me and motioned for me to toss it to them, which I did, and she had quite the big smile on her face. Definitely made that quite a happy memorable event for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately I might have went a little overboard trying to get her to notice me online somehow and would tag her and her bandmates (her bandmates because she seems pretty heavily reserved and closed off to fanmail/fan communications of any kind, which is her right of course and understandable given the dangers in this world with some dangerous people) saying how much her music has helped me some days and how happy that moment was seeing her happy from the gift I got her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her bandmates definitely noticed the post but of course they don't say anything, which sends my anxiety into overdrive, but thinking more rationally about it now, they do have their own busy lives and are currently all on tour, plus I'm not owed any communication from anyone anyway, which wouldn't be fair to expect anuway. I'm sure they were happy seeing the post I tagged them in as it's not like it was anything negative, but maybe perhaps I was just thirsting for a little bit of validation or acknowledgement with trying to be noticed online like that. A way to make me feel a little less lonely and knowing an artist saw how impactful their work has been to me etc..\n",

      "At this point I stopped that and am just going to try to respect them all by just giving them space and just trying to be happy from that good memory of the plush animal thing, and continuing to support them by listening to more future music from them and following their other works in other bands etc. I love music and finding new artists every day, music definitely can bring lots of people together from different backgrounds which I love\n",

I fear what might happen or how badly I might snap when things inevitably get way more stressful in my life with family getting older and dying off, making me feel even more lonely. Unfortunately even with the huge heart I have, many people misunderstand me, misunderstand my huge fear I have of things like being ignored, etc.. I hate that sometimes I can stress myself out from anxiety and stress and depression that I can lash out which I usually quickly regret afterwards. I really don't know how much longer I can take just trying to get better and improve and learn to cope and be happy but I do know that when things get way more difficult, it's going to be extremely hard for me to really think of any reason for me to stay here.

And I hate when people talk about college, I mean, when my family's close friends ask if I'm going, or if professors talk about college...

      "I believe that anyone who thinks that any of the mainstream antidepressants that are available now are helping their depression, are benefitting from the placebo effect. There really is no such thing as a double blind study, they are compromised by the side effects, which tend to negate the \"blind\" part of the study. Even given this limitation, the results are still not significant, at least not clinically. There is very little difference between the placebo and the actual medicine. I don't understand why these Pharmaceutical companies can get this stuff approved. There are many drugs that work right away and have significant effects on mood and depression, but they are not prescribed because of fear of abuse and addiction. I think that if we could regulate that better, we could make a lot of progress on depression and anxiety.

I relate to hearing voices it comes and goes months apart years. My life story isn't meant for this comment. You gotta understand that you are actual have a gift for describing it. For me it was like a gift i never recived for christmas. I wanted it to come I tried but I was left empty at the christmas tree. Another way I could describe is like being drowned but always getting at least one breathe in. So it was this loop of me sitting there imaging how it would feel how it would feel to finally be gone. The aroma of dried vomit mixed in with morning after regret of I have to go to work now. The amount of times I've woken up from a anti psychotics and sleep meds. Dude no one in my family cares because my family sucks dude. Sometimes you are born into situations where the noose is tied but instead of dropping you you are left to rot in the sun to eventually be set free. I have alot to be thankful for i've gotten passed that but sometimes people just wont care. People tend to pick and choose what struggle is. That's society. Struggle shouldn't be a competition but it ends up being it because that's life. Why the none insane response because this sobered me up. I kinda thought man Im unemployed alone with no care for reaching out unless my mother complained. I thought Im the only one rotting hoping to get a buzz or a blackout. Look today almost made me go ok this and that but look bro never side with people just because you wanna go ok here you go. I understand that comment will go seen one day idk. To be fair I deserve any negative attention. Why im sharing that is because you should never be out there sinking. You breath you live you are. That's life.

I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).\n",

I explained all my symptoms to the dr I saw today and expressed my concerns to her about taking benzos every day (family history of addiction and I find myself to have a very obsessive personality.) and she totally agreed with me and said I probably have GAD along with the depression. She added an anti-seizure med as a mood stabilizer and told me that should hopefully level out how I am feeling and take care of the anxiety that is probably being brought on by the anti-depressant.

      "When I have a thought and that thought makes me feel good, it is because that thought is true, that thought is in alignment with my true nature, according to my higher self\\infinite intelligence that thought is correct, it is the right way for me “define” myself and to go in life. When someone says to you “You are beautiful”, “I love you”, “I enjoy being around you”, … That makes you feel good, because those thoughts are TRUE, those thoughts are showing you who you are, you are loved, you are beautiful, you are and incredible person to be around with. (In my case, I feel in heaven when someone says to me “You make me feel amazing” 🙂 ) The same goes with your on thoughts and perspectives (that’s what you attract every time btw), when you define yourself/think of yourself in a way that makes you feel good, like “I feel worthy”, “I love myself”, “I love being me”, “I truly like my new shirt”, “I’m having so much fun”, “I’m at peace and relaxed”, you are going in the right way, the right direction,  forward and aligned with your dreams and passions. From feeling fine to feeling ecstasy and Infinite Love, it is true for you, those thoughts and perspectives are the ones that will serve you in amazing ways and that will bring you the tremendous benefits for you and for your life, keep choosing them, believe in them, bathe yourself in them.\n",

At the time, both my psychiatrist and therapist thought I was in the mild to moderate range. Lexapro was good. It was great, really. I wasn't born with depression.\n",

It took me awhile to find a psychiatrist that was accepting patients, but I finally saw one yesterday. In regards to the strange symptoms I had as a result of taking the 2nd pill by accident, she said that \"since 20mg is already the max dose of Lexapro, taking 40mg could produce psychotic symptoms.\"\n",

The group I will be with are ecstatic about the cruise, and have no issue with sitting in a recliner and doing nothing. I, however, don't want to be alone with my thoughts. I plan on bringing books, audio books, podcasts, and whatever videos I can cram on my device(s), but reading or listening to something during an activity or around the group will probably be seen as rude or anti-social. The wifi on the ship is supposedly terrible and expensive, so I can't even casually browse reddit - which is normally my go-to distraction.\n",

      "I've suffered from a mild anxiety disorder w/ depression (diagnosed) for about 4 years, all while I've been with my (now) DH. DH is logical/rational to a fault, and while generally supportive, cannot understand how I feel and act when depressed, or suffering from particularly bad anxiety. No matter how I try to explain to him, tell him that I literally cannot help it or just magically lift myself out of it, he insists that I'm being \"dramatic\". It makes me feel all the more vulnerable, and all the more difficult to speak for myself. What advise/experience do you have for helping someone understand who has never experienced depression and/or anxiety that the disorder is \"real\" and not in active control of the victim?\n",

Honestly, there was a lot of support and encouragement to seek treatment from people I talked to about it previously.

Clark and I would call each other to update on how my medical credential process was going and he would share about his family. He would always repeat to me, “Manuel, I don’t know how much longer I can handle the fast pace of the Bay Area. People are in a rush and they don’t even know what they are in a rush for.” One of the new grievances was the “Avenue” he lives on that he jokingly calls “an expressway.” The sound of constant vehicle traffic is definitely a contrast to an area previously filled with orchards.\n",

She's well-connected at my workplace, so gets lots of support from her \"friends\" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her \"version\" of situations. This is problematic, because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff, customers, and myself, but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum.

It’s nothing hard yet I feel so ashamed when I tell my family and partner that I didn’t simply like the job or feel like it’s demanding too much of me atm. It’s like getting a job takes so much from me atleast socially.\n",

      "That was easy, I was probably anxious about my health because I lost a very close relative when I was 11. The second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. Checking my records of doctor visits, I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.\n",

I've never lived in a place like this before because it's an en-suite with my own double bedroom and bathroom, but the kitchen and lounge is shared with about 15 other 'profressionals' It's right in the centre of a bustling city near all the bars and music venues. I've always lived in the suburbs but I've always felt a bit disconnected from everything because most of my (limited) social life takes place in the city centre. But now I'm scared because I'm such an introvert and there's going to be lots of people around all the time and I'm worried I've made a mistake. Another big worry of mine is that my ex best friend lives just a few streets away from where I will be living and we are going to be sharing the same supermarket etc.\n",

      "I tried some cheese and some had pretty intense flavors and being an highly sensitive person this i think caused some stress. We stood for about an hour when i felt this dropping feeling in my stomach. I knew this was a sign to get some food and sit down but my dad was very happy checking out cheeses so i risked just waiting and chilling out. Then my whole body felt that dropping sensation and my hearing started going. I started getting warm and it felt like pin needles on my body.\n",

      "Hourly employees start arriving at 4am and then myself and the other managers will delegate the days plan to the employees. We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items, recover the floor and excute the GM’s planned item moves for the day, so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I don’t mind physical labor and hard work, it’s actually my favorite part of my job, but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks, but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so it’s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours, or helping out in the deli and/or bakery.

      "Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person, well it ended up being exactly what I feared, she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so \"over dramatic\" and that \"I'm just anxious for attention\".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own, she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that, but she has been like this for a few years now, I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was \"nothing\" and it turned out to be cellulitis. Ever since I came back from Melbourne, I've just been overthinking things, and when I do, it flares the anxiety right up.\n",

      "I recently became depressed and am now understanding that I’ve also had anxiety my whole life but I am waiting to see a specialist to have a diagnosis. My doctor is pretty easy goin and will give me pretty much whatever medication I want. Lately I’ve been trying this and trying that to find a good combination of meds. My foquest would make me very depressed in the evenings and morning so I went off foquest and went on Wellbutrin XL at 150mg a day. This helped my depression but my attention, memory, and focus faltered.\n",

But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up. Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years. During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis. So it seems to me this long chronic anxiety and the resulting hyperventilation and shallow breathing and high blood pressure did make my immune system rather weak or damaged.\n",

Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person!

He's Spanish so English is his second language, which probably doesn't help his anxiety when talking to an American. Last night he came over and he told me had anxiety and depression issues and he's seeing a doctor.\n",

      "The first six months I had her she lived in a cage that could have fit two rats, the next year and a half she lived in a cage that could have fit four rats (this is following the formula where you multiply the dimensions of the cage in inches and divide it by 3456. The result tells you how many rats you can comfortably have in one cage.) I loved buying her new toys and treats and seeing how she took them. Trying new foods on her was one of my favorite things to do. The only issue is that I didn't really let her out of the cage much.\n",

      "This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like \"what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him\" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him. I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel. Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking. This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!\n",

      "In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with \"I wanted to see you more than anything.\" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.\n",

      "Long story short: Worked in a call centre for 4 years for a vehicle breakdown service, starting to not be able to cope with it any more due to a combination of things (change in management, not enough staff for a constantly expanding customer base, rewards based on whether your face \"fits\" rather than actual demonstrable achievements, etc). Unable to relax after work, constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it, either intensely rageful, or wanting to burst in to tears. Headaches that go on for 3 or 4 days at a time are now a regular occurence. Starting to manifest in other physical ways (unable to sleep, constantly weary, having a lot more sickness than usual).\n",

Also I can’t sleep I’m getting 5 hours ish a night and I used to get 8 hours everyday. I don’t know what to do whether I’m justified going to a doctor or I’m just being stupid and making people with real anxiety and other mental illness look bad I feel like I’m being stupid and I hate my personality.

I also struggle with the feeling like I’m making all this up and none of my problems exist which I know rationally cannot be true when I’ve struggled with this for most my life, however I still can’t shift it. I don’t know if this is part of my anxiety making me feel like this or whether it is another thing I’ve made myself believe. I guess I’m just looking for some advice and reassurance. I’m just really tired of feeling this way and constantly being in turmoil with my mind.\n",

After going home this winter my parents dropped the bombshell on me that they are struggling to pay my tuition. The thing is, although we are not super rich or anything, my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing, the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up. My tuition is due this friday and I just called my parents and woke them up to inform them that its getting really serious now (my dad promised to make an arrangement with his friend to pay my tuition).\n",

      "More specifically, for example, I live with roommates and I can't remember the last time it has been quiet in the apartment. There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer.\n",

She’s been remembering some things from her childhood, and, with the help of her therapist, is trying to process and heal. We don’t live in the same area, and when we got together about a month ago, she filled me in on some of those issues. About a week later, she told me that she was taking a break from electronics in order to try to process and heal, and that she and her therapist had been talking about it for a while. She said she was putting her phone on airplane mode and that she’d check it in a few days and that she’d check her email about once a week.\n",

Every time this happens, I always feel like my future is bleak and hopeless, my rank is gonna drop like hell, and I'm worthless compared to the other people who do better than me. I'm always driven to think lesser of myself in comparison to other people and I always hate myself because of it. Now the pain is becoming unbearable to the point I nearly start screaming, sobbing alone in my bedroom out of grief.

      "During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms. Overall we’ve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.\n",

      "Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.\n",

I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?\n",

The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one, so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with, he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable, so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.\n",

      "Hello everyone. I am wondering what experiences people have with using Mirtazapine as their main antidepressant for depressive and anxious symptoms (low energy, heavy feeling, irritability, concentration problems, insomnia, inability to complete mundane everyday tasks, social anxiety, fear of embarrassment, worry or overthinking about socialization, etc)? I am in therapy using a mixed method approach so suggestions of therapy aren't relevant. I have just begun proper psychotherapy, and I am looking for something to help me when dealing with reality outside the therapist office. My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.\n",

I became more irritable, rude, negative and angry... which was not like my usual positive, polite, and bubbly self. He was often very negative, had anger issues/tantrums, impatient, interrupted me a lot, would ditch me for cocaine, didn't know how to drink alcohol (often consumes until he pukes), was a hypochondriac, always broke (yet had money for weed/shatter or sports betting or junk food or alcohol...), but at the same time did not look after his own health unless I pushed him to... just a lot of care-taking and issues. He has depression and anxiety as well. One of the things that really killed me inside about him was his last girlfriend who had died in a car crash about 1 year before he met me.\n",

      "Even present-day situations where they are receiving love from a safe person can trigger the awareness and subsequent grief of knowing how unloved they were by comparison. Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder.\n",

      "This isn't the first time this has happened, even with my ex I used to put effort into creating funny and deep conversations and she'd make quite surface level replies, but I thought it was because she was severely depressed so I didn't mind making an effort with her. Am I missing something? She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job. I should probably mention she's really really shy, which she has admitted to me. For example, when we meet in person, she's so nervous that she's physically shaking for about 15 minutes until she relaxes.\n",

      "Unfortunately with the way things have worked out this month, I am left with little cash until my SSDI is deposited a week from Friday. And normally I’d say I’d just wait until then to take my dog, Kane, to the vet, but he has developed a little bit of a cough, and he doesn’t seem as active as he normally is (<2yo chocolate lab, so he should be pretty active). I called the vet and they suspect it could be heartworms, so while I have the $50 for the office visit, I don’t have the $45 for the test. Any help towards this would be greatly appreciated.

      "I've mostly come to terms with it but every time i see his name or face or his girlfriend's it comes back. My question is, when the justice system fails, how do you deal with living near a child molester when you can't just pick up and leave? The only thing that prevents me from making sure he dissapears is the risk of getting caught and how that would hurt my family even more. It's just so hard seeing him walking around free after what he did and what i have no doubt he will do again. How do I deal with this when I am already prone to depression?\n",

      "If you go to my post history, you can get a picture of how I got to where I am in life today. I am here today because of the choices I made. Currently I'm unemployed and I don't have a degree. I stay at home all day doing nothing. That's mainly how I've wasted the past five years of my life. I wish I went off to university, took it seriously, made a group of friends, and studied abroad. I wake up every day and think about how I would be studying abroad right now and the memories I would have made. There are no second chances since I come from a low income family. I ask myself why I did the things I did, even though I know that my family is working class. I don't come from a wealthy background so what made me think I had any time or money to waste? Now I am 5 years (which is a fucking long time) behind everyone and I'm watching all of my friends graduate, study in Europe (which I want but will never get to do due to finances, ruining my academic record, and running out of time), and make good money. There is literally no way to catch up to not just to my friends, but to the vision I had for my life. I also still live with my parents in the 570 sq ft one bedroom apartment that I grew up in (I sleep in the living room on a twin bed). I can't stand to live here anymore, but I'm broke. I don't even want to live in Canada anymore. Moving elsewhere likely wouldn't make me happier since I would be even more lonely than I am now. Getting a minimum wage job and moving out is not the solution because minimum wage/close to minimum wage is not sustainable for the rest of my life. The only thing I can feasibly do is get a bachelor's in nursing, but it feels like a last resort. I know I left myself with no choices. I really cannot see myself living in this city for the next 5-7 years and have been contemplating suicide. I really feel trapped and don't see a way out. I had a vision for my 20s, which would have started with a memorable time in university, but I not only missed the boat on that, I have wasted 5 years of youth that I will never get back and am left in a position where I'll be poor for a very long time. University would have been the most likely and easiest place for dating, but that option is closed to me forever. That environment is important to me because it would have been the most organic way to make friends and to meet someone my age to date. Now the time for fun has passed (during which I didn't even have fun), the only thing that's left is work, being poor, and loneliness.\n",

I'm tired of constantly feeling like I have to be the strong one because no one else will be. I'm tired of all the times I've expressed how I feel just to go unheard. I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one willing to actually take care of my kids needs. I'm tired of wondering if I'm enough. I'm tired of being the breadwinner, housekeeper, father, mother, community to raise everyone else's kids, and the foundation for my job. I'm tired of not feeling like I'm enough for my kids, like I'm not able to do enough, be there enough, and provide enough. I'm tired of constantly watching the neglect happen but not being able to do anything to change it. I'm tired of not being enough. This life is getting the best of me, and maybe the worst. I wasn't prepared for this. And I'm completely alone in my support system to figure out where to go, what to do, who to trust, etc. I don't trust anyone, maybe because I don't trust myself. I'm tired of drinking my life away to feel happiness or relief. I'm tired of smoking weed and seeing the financial burden it plays into our finances. I'm tired of constantly talking in conversations but getting nothing back, like it's all one sided. I'm tired of feeling like I'm too smart for what I do, but too dumb for this world. I'm tired of feeling like I'm never enough. For my kids. My wife. My job. Myself. My God. I'm tired. But sleep and rest don't help. The world keeps turning. The days continue and the sun will still rise and set as though nothing has happened. As though the weight of this lethargicism is not slowly stopping my world from spinning. I'm tired. But sleep doesn't fix the heartache, the abuse, the trauma, the memories that keep me up at night nor the thoughts that are burned into my brain. You're not enough. You're not good enough. You're a failure. You're lazy. You're dumber than a box of rocks. You will never amount to anything. You will end up in jail. You're a deadbeat dad. You're a terrible husband and partner. The world will be better without you. Quieter. But better. I'm tired of feeling like I can control my job, or I can control my house, but I can't do both. I'm tired of constantly feeling like the bad guy, with the best intentions. I'm tired of being misunderstood because of my ability to speak my mind, and seen as intimidating because of my size and the sound of my voice. I'm tired of the judgement. Of the hurt. Of the endless days of toil with no end in sight. I'm tired of this world. But I'm tired of the thought of leaving it and leaving these kids and wife behind. They would get money, but would it matter? Would it make a difference? Would things change? Would the world suddenly be a happier place? Would these kids function the way they should when life comes at them? Sometimes, I wonder if it's worth it. And some days I have reasons to keep going. But it seems like more and more days I have no idea why I try anymore. I go unheard. I go unloved. I am overworked, overstimulated, and overly positive that I have given almost everything I can with nothing to show for it but struggle. I envy the animals whose lives are so simple. The fish that swim everywhere. The birds who fly freely. I'd give anything to feel some morsel of energy or rejuvenation again. I'm so tired, but we keep going because that's what good soldiers do. I hope it's worth it in the end. That we get everything we have worked so hard for. That I can look back someday and wholeheartedly believe that I did everything I could to build the best life possible for my wife and kids. That I can live out my last days with no regrets, knowing that all the compromise, struggles, endless days and nights, and days I spent feeling so  alone actually paid off, because right now, it seems like a task as big as a mountain. And I don't know if I can climb a mountain right now, because I'm tired..\n",

Growing up in Indian culture as a girl you'll quickly realize that you are worthless.I was the second born daughter in my family everyone in the hospital gave my parents their condolences Or so i was told by my mother and since then everything that has happened to me has been my fault.

I am extremely miserable. I have been looking up ways to kill myself. I'm either going to have to buy a gun or borrow one from someone, or if I'm desperate enough, I'm going to try carbon monoxide.

I went through some really bad addiction with drugs and alcohol which is ultimately why she left.... I was a disaster and really lost all my friends and self respect from the way I handled it all those years ago... It was a shit show. Fast forward to today.

She married some bald guy she met in college shorty after she got away from me. It just cuts me so deep. I hate myself for the way I acted and the things I did. Also, I've never driven by houses or tried to come in physical contact but I know that a lot of people would consider keeping up with her life as creepy... I have had girlfriends since and actually did some traveling for a while and at one point in between the time we split and now I did some traveling and was really living my life without a thought or care in the world about this... But somehow I always come full circle and really wish I were a different person. I don't like myself and have really reduced myself to being at a computer most waking hours of most days... Sometimes I start to think clearly and know I wouldnt know what to do with a wife that is such a catch and so put together. I can't keep someone like that happy....

I have spent my entire life between ages 9-18 in and out of mental hospitals, bouncing between therapist to therapist and psychiatrist to psychiatrist. I am out of medication to try and my next option is shock therapy.

      "I have always had one person in my life at a time that i DEEPLY care for and love to my core, and everything about them controls my every emotion. My father died when i was 10 and my mother has raised me very sheltered from the real world, she acts like a child. she teaches pre schoolers and has pretty much my whole life, acts like a 3 year old teacher outside of work as well. extremely childish and hasn’t been in my life very much for about a year or so now. \n",

      "i currently have a boyfriend of 2 years and we have gone through absolute hell with each other. he told me he wanted to break up for a while about 2 weeks ago and we had a conversation and i convinced him to give me another chance. when we first got together i dropped every single thing in my life to cater to him and anything that he needed or wanted. NEVER said no. he was a bit abusive and took advantage of that in our early relationship, but we went through a lot and he has changed quite a bit. then i met a girl, my first friend that i saw on a daily in almost 3 years. i have zero sense of self and identity and as a result i become the people i am around daily. i saw how she lashes out on people when they’re doing something fucked up. so i began to have this mentality that i don’t need to respect what my boyfriend asks of me and i can say whatever i want to him. like “i can’t be doing anything wrong and even if i am it doesn’t matter because i’ve done so much for him in the past”. after one of my rants and me bashing him for past things he said he wanted space and wanted to break up for a while. we had a conversation and i realized a lot of things i have been doing wrong and he decided to give me another chance.\n",

      "today he decided to go speed in his car with a friend and decided to turn his location off while he was doing it. when he called me to tell me this he was being very snarky and i got upset, i did not bash him but i told him how he sounded and how the situation didn’t make sense. he then told me he wants to have an in person conversation about our relationship. i asked if we are okay, like as a couple. and he said that that’s exactly what he wants to talk about, because ‘we are not on the same page about that subject’. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since this happened today i have been genuinely considering suicide. My emotions are not in my own control and they never have been, they are merely at the mercy of whoever i deeply care about. and that has been him for a long time. before we got together i always kept trying to kill myself my whole life because i was utterly unable to see any sort of future for myself, my mind would blank, i would slip into an extremely depressive state at just the thought of what a “future” would be. then me and him started dating and that changed. for ONCE in my life i finally saw a future and i finally saw a reason to keep living, he gave that to me. he is the reason i have kept attempting to work on my mental health and to cope in the moments where i feel suicidal. when i tell him he is my world and he is EVERYTHING to me. i mean that with every single fiber of my being. we are one. \n",
      "\n",
      "without him i again have no future, i see absolutely nothing for myself, he is the one who gave me something to see in that aspect. he allowed me to see the beauty in life even when i could not feel any beauty in the moment. no medication helps me no amount of therapy helps me NOTHING does except the love i feel from him. \n",
      "\n",
      "so i guess what i’m here to say is, why live when my life and emotions and being are completely subject to this person? that is not fair to him in the slightest. he obviously needs space which i don’t understand but breaking up and giving him space feels like sudden death to me. physically not just mentally i physically feel pain imagining it. literaly my entire life as far as i can remember centers around one person and their mood and their attitude towards me, and what i feel from them. this isn’t something that will just change. i do not want to live if this is what my life will always be. it is agonizing. and i do not want to be told that ‘it won’t always be this way’ because yes it will, it always has and no matter what i do or what i try, it always is this way. if he wants to stay with me then i have a reason to continue living and continue fighting my depression and everything. but at the same time it’s conflicting because i cannot control him and how he acts, therefore i am always completely subjective to HIM. i do not want to be alive if this is what my life means.\n",

Since then, I ended up in disability for my severe anxiety and depression and for 7 years I did some volonteer work but never had a real job.

      "I'm not really sure where to begin. Was in college and took a break 3 years go because I just feel like it wasn't for me despite having great grades. I come from a poor Hispanic household so I knew I  had to go back to do something for my parents. However my father was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer stage 2. I know stage 2 isn't as life threatening but my father who is 62, and has nobody else besides me, bcuz him and my mom are separated. It wayed down heavly on my mentally. My father got treated at out local hospital but that hospital could not help him anymore after 6 months because his cancer was growing rapidy and so he was transfered and put on a clinical trial to help stop it. I thought that would be the end of my worries but my mother passed away  last year due to a blood infection, and the month prior to that I lost my job. And her family and me spent alot money sending her back to the mexico where she was buried. I accuried debt because of all this. I miss mom alot, she was in my eyes a bad ass mexican mom who never showed an ounce of being scared, always fearless, tough. I'm sure people who grow in a Hispanic house hold understand that.Seeing someone like her, who was always strong and showed unconditional love to me. Die in the way she did. Messed up. I feel useless not being able to even buy her a house or do anything for her. And I feel the same for father. I always grew up thinking I do something for them and help them. And now one of them is gone. I don't have a job. I just feel embarrassed and stuff.\n",

I told him no that I was not ok with it. He has cancelled several appointments for one reason or another in the past few months.

He helped me through my sisters suicide and a near mental breakdown, but now it seems like our sessions are just not a priority, and it makes me feel awful, and I hardly need help feeling that way.

      "I don't know where to start, I was diagnosed a week ago (last Saturday), I haven't started treatment yet. My world turned upside down, so many things happened, I ended up canceling my university registration, I appeared to be very shaken by an event; the person I understand that I love, because it fits all the logic of love, kissed someone else, and that was just one of the triggers; I put everything I understood into question. I questioned myself from start to finish and I still question myself, I don't feel like I'm ready to live, much less that I'll be ready one day. I have been struggling with depression since I was a child, and I always understood that the problem was me, in my way of thinking, being, acting, which made me try to kill myself a few times, I never got far, the third time I tried I must have been around 12 years old and that was when I put a knife to my neck and pressed. I couldn't finish the job, and I never understood why. This was always in my head, I always called myself a coward for it. But now that actually seems to have been something, something that had never crossed my mind, but that never stopped showing signs, 2 years ago I started going to the gym, I went alone and thought about life while I was pushing, I stopped 5 months ago. After the entrance exams and I started to move away from the school environment, I started walking, aimlessly, I just took a bottle of water and walked for hours, for kilometers, and I wasn't understanding why, and now I see (still very reluctantly) that these moments of impulsiveness that I called \"I don't know\", were me telling myself to live, this is so shocking, at one point I was trying to understand why my emotion of living surpasses even today the \"rationality\" of dying. I spent years being completely sure of my undeniable desire for death, to now understand that this IS an illness. That I'm not really like that, that everything I know about myself is covered by a morbid veil and, pardon the pun, a depressive veil. I haven't started taking depression medication yet, on those days to try to intensify the crises I ended up taking heavier medications for focus and attention, I don't know if they had any effect, but I took about 4 capsules at once. \n",
      "I'm feeling like I'm in limbo, I'm just existing, at that moment I just said goodnight to my \"beloved\" she was at college and was tired, I was blaming myself so much for making her go through this, not just her, but mainly her, we have several friends and she's kind of the center of the group, and one of the closest to her also has depression, he's known for longer than me, I talked to him this week, and I was so worried about him, I've never had as much hope as I am. this week, I even left my room, but I thought so much, I even read it. I ended up going to chat gpt my situation and asked if there was any school or philosophical or social or psychological current that fit my thoughts (a way of searching for thoughts or at least paths/tools to reach something), he told me what my beloved told me (she has been through problematic situations too) I am very idealistic, I didn't have a good philosophical education in high school, I didn't know what idealism is, and he also told me that I have existentialist thoughts (in this case, I've heard about Sartre, but I always avoided reading anything because it seemed like I would freak out if I really understood). This ended up catching me off guard, I didn't know that the thoughts I was guided by actually had the name \"idealism\" and that they had so many problems. From what I understand, and also from conversations with older people, who don't have as much intellectual knowledge but have a lot of experience, they told me that this is something normal, this feeling (which worried me, because walking to college and seeing a bus passing by and wanting to jump on it, doesn't seem like that's normal), and that it's a passing thing, that I should take it easy, I shouldn't have missed this college opportunity, that I should start to occupy my mind so that I don't have space or time to think about it anymore, that I should get a job, a girlfriend, train, get to know the city (because I moved. For reasons of reference, I'm from Brazil, I'm from the interior of the state of São Paulo in a city with 140 thousand inhabitants, and I moved to the state capital, which has 16 million inhabitants, even more in fact) and that that will always be with me and I should lean on these things... I'm afraid, I didn't think I was leaning on my loved one but in the end I was, I hurt myself for one reason only. mine, an unnecessary question in my opinion, she tells me that I am someone very important to her (since the event, I imagine that based on my reaction, she hasn't said that she loves me. Which was already a shock when she said it for the first time because she had an emotional block, she told me that I was her first love, I don't know how I could make her understand a feeling of that magnitude for someone like me in the state I'm in), and I hurt myself alone for a reason that made my mind complex and made it 20 times worse than what had actually happened. I have no religion, as a Brazilian descendant of Italians I was raised under the rules of the Catholic church, and my first reactions of dissatisfaction in relation to these emotional supports were in the church. I'm very afraid of holding on to something again, and holding on tighter, because that would help me get through it, it would be so much more pleasurable, just throwing faith in the hands of a perfect God... But that doesn't enter my head, I won't be able to support myself in religion, in sport or in studies, I don't look badly on those who don't support them, but I judge them. The course I took was for the sake of being the easiest for me to get into, geography, I'm good at it and I like consuming content about it, I didn't study once for the entrance exam, it was just video classes while I played, it gave me a moral blow when I found out that I passed (for those who don't know, passing a public university in Brazil is the ideal for a career), I didn't feel like I belonged to that place, I didn't make an effort to be there, while the friends I took I knew they made an effort, they wanted to, I didn't... I had been taking classes for a month now, I barely read the texts the teachers gave me, I just paid attention in class, and I imagined arriving at my rented kitchenette which had so many problems that I didn't feel comfortable, but at least it was a place where I could, I don't know, take off my clothes, sit on the floor and cry. \n",

      "I understand this period now, as a period of extreme immaturity, for making so many decisions without feeling, although nothing is relevant. It's a period in which I'm seeing how I don't know life, and how I'm trying to understand it, and up until now I've only idealized it, and I'm afraid of idealizing it yet, I don't know if I should go back to my studies after the treatment starts, if I should try something that the chances of me regretting are minimal, I'd like to try medicine or psychology, be able to help people, and research and try to understand what they and I have. The problem is that these courses are extremely competitive, medicine for example, there is a college in my city that is one of the best in my country, but it is so competitive that the number of mistakes in the entrance exam is around a maximum of 5 points, in a test where you can get 200, in other words, I couldn't make a mistake. Should I put myself in this situation? Probably years of study, or if I have another miracle (ahahah) I can pass it this year or next year? Should I go after my love and try to make it as strong as I can, or should I maintain a relationship without so much romantic closeness (which she would like) or should I just treat her as a friend that I love. I'm afraid of people forgetting me, I don't know if I would feel free in peace, or if I would feel free to kill myself. From what I understand, I should take advantage of this moment to understand myself (I don't know how) and focus on myself, stop putting people before me, think more about myself, which are thoughts that bother me because they seem selfish, even though everyone tells me they aren't, because unfortunately the only thing I have that isn't so fleeting is me.\n",
      "I don't know if anyone will read all of this, I would like to thank you for your efforts (I really can't imagine anyone reading all of this, so thank you very much if you read S2). Now I honestly don't know how to live, and from what I'm finding out, no one does. I'll try to read more, I think this is the support that seems to bring the most benefits, which I can perhaps pass on to others (I would like to have children hahah). I don't know if I'm turning this disease into something very psychological yet, THESE THINGS ARE DISEASES, I have to understand this to continue. \n",

I'm sure they were happy seeing the post I tagged them in as it's not like it was anything negative, but maybe perhaps I was just thirsting for a little bit of validation or acknowledgement with trying to be noticed online like that. A way to make me feel a little less lonely and knowing an artist saw how impactful their work has been to me etc..\n",

I hate that sometimes I can stress myself out from anxiety and stress and depression that I can lash out which I usually quickly regret afterwards. I really don't know how much longer I can take just trying to get better and improve and learn to cope and be happy but I do know that when things get way more difficult, it's going to be extremely hard for me to really think of any reason for me to stay here.

      "Hi there, I have had depression my entire life. I also have anxiety and OCD. I was recently prescribed Prozac, which has helped my OCD and anxiety immensely. I was also prescribed hydroxyzine for anxiety/panic attacks, but that made me sleepy for days. My doctor recommended that I try propanolol instead, but all I see about it online is that it causes / worsens everyone’s depression. I’m wondering if anyone has had the opposite experience? Thank you in advance, as I already took some and THEN read everything online after, and now I’m scared. \n",

I don't even cry anymore, I just accept bad shit happening to me, like it's meant to happen, and pretty much just live with a nonchalant face, not even looking depressed anymore, cause in my head, I'm already dead, no future to fight for, so I don't care what the present's like.\n",

I was also pregnant and alone when she died because my son's father just up and abandoned us(never came back). I spent that birthday alone. The two people I had considered my best friends since childhood were like different people. neither came to her funeral. neither showed up to my baby shower. one person did. it was humiliating. no body came to see or help me after i had him. people fucking suck. i genuinely have no idea how to get over knowing this about people. its been five years now and well… idk where you are at but i am in the US and with the state of things and the hatred seeping from every crevice… life sucks.\n",

He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, my marriage was never good but the unconditional love of a child is magical. With him I have visited almost every state and we have traveled internationally as well. I guess my point is that although you feel the teenage years will be the best there is still a lot of experiences for you to have as an adult.

      "I believe that anyone who thinks that any of the mainstream antidepressants that are available now are helping their depression, are benefitting from the placebo effect. There really is no such thing as a double blind study, they are compromised by the side effects, which tend to negate the \"blind\" part of the study. Even given this limitation, the results are still not significant, at least not clinically. There is very little difference between the placebo and the actual medicine. I don't understand why these Pharmaceutical companies can get this stuff approved. There are many drugs that work right away and have significant effects on mood and depression, but they are not prescribed because of fear of abuse and addiction. I think that if we could regulate that better, we could make a lot of progress on depression and anxiety. I believe that inadequate relief for depression is more harmful than any effects of the drugs that actually work.\n",

I get ups as well and what I'd suggest is to get a a job if you wanna be independent and start working on any skills you can polish. I'm somewhat a jack of all trades and that's my problem cuz i can't focus on one career path but i have always stick with my most polished skill and i won't let go of that until i actually think i am good enough in any other skill.\n",

      "I used to feel the same way everyday dreaming about it like some sick trip to disney land. The options the risks stories about it sitting in it. I never wanna go back to that place. I relate to hearing voices it comes and goes months apart years. My life story isn't meant for this comment. You gotta understand that you are actual have a gift for describing it. For me it was like a gift i never recived for christmas. I wanted it to come I tried but I was left empty at the christmas tree. Another way I could describe is like being drowned but always getting at least one breathe in. So it was this loop of me sitting there imaging how it would feel how it would feel to finally be gone. The aroma of dried vomit mixed in with morning after regret of I have to go to work now. The amount of times I've woken up from a anti psychotics and sleep meds. Dude no one in my family cares because my family sucks dude. Sometimes you are born into situations where the noose is tied but instead of dropping you you are left to rot in the sun to eventually be set free. I have alot to be thankful for i've gotten passed that but sometimes people just wont care. People tend to pick and choose what struggle is. That's society. Struggle shouldn't be a competition but it ends up being it because that's life. Why the none insane response because this sobered me up. I kinda thought man Im unemployed alone with no care for reaching out unless my mother complained. I thought Im the only one rotting hoping to get a buzz or a blackout. Look today almost made me go ok this and that but look bro never side with people just because you wanna go ok here you go. I understand that comment will go seen one day idk. To be fair I deserve any negative attention. Why im sharing that is because you should never be out there sinking. You breath you live you are. That's life. Keep on limping bro that's still moving.\n",
